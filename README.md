# Java BootCamp base folders layout

Please, use this repository as a base for you training phase. The idea is to
fork this project so everyone use the same folder structure for the
exercises.

It's extremelly important to keep the key points easy to be verified by
the reviewers, so **don't mix the key points with the rest of the
exercises**

###Objective

This course teaches the basics of Java development applications.

→ [index](#index)

###Who Should Attend

The training will start at a low level and does not require in depth knowledge of the platform in question. Desirable participant profile: trainees and outside Globant candidates. A basic knowledge on OOP is desired, though.

→ [index](#index)

###Duration

Four weeks total.

Three weeks for guided learning and one week for app development. 

→ [index](#index)

###Technical Assistance

You can contact other bootcamp participants or any available tutor if you need technical assistance. We will create one chat for boot camp members only, and another one for boot camp members and tutors when boot camp starts.

###Performance Measurement

1. Code review after each practice and sprint

2. Checkpoint completion after Learning stage with your assigned tutor

→ [index](#index)


###Handling Advanced Developers

Developers that move faster than average can go ahead and complete as much exercises as wanted. 

→ [index](#index)

###Materials

1. Install [Java SDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

2. The IDE to use is [Eclipse for Java Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

3. Skype Account + headset (audio calls)

4. Create your own [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. Follow this [guideline](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) to setup your account. Also you can read further about Git in [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

5. Fork this repo https://github.com/juanpablopizarro/java-bootcamp to use as a base to host the project code.

###General Guidelines

The boot camp is organized in the following way:

1. The first three weeks will be used for intensive self learning. Each topic will have reading and practices parts. Tutors will be available to answer technical questions on a given chat room. 

2. The next week will be used to develop an application following a life process.

3. The project manager will coordinate learning days encouraging team communication in daily meetings.

4. The project manager will gather information regarding individual progress so we can look for alternative assistance where needed.

5. The project manager will lead the boot camp sprints as if it were a real project using SCRUM agile methodology.

6. Two boot camp chats will be created for feedback and technical assistance:

    1. Bootcamp HTML - ALL
Every person participating in the bootcamp is present here (students, tutors and PMs). Here is the place to ask for technical assistance!

    2. Bootcamp HTML - Assistants
Here you will reach just your boot camp fellows for asking question sharing knowledge.

7. Team play is encouraged but the work will be evaluated per person.

8. Sprint duration will be 1 week.

9. The instructions will be vague as they generally are in real life projects. You must look for support and guidance from your PM, teammates and tutors.

10. All code and documentation must be in English.

11. Code must adhere to Globant’s UI [Java coding guidelines](https://github.com/globant-ui/html-style-guide). (update url)

###Proposed Test Applications

The test application will consist in TBD.

###Learning Days###

Each day you will grab the fundamentals of the key building blocks for usual Java applications.

On each learning day you will have to:

1. ####Read:####
We will provide you with documentation related with current sprint content so you can have a background reference, guide and examples to complete the following practice.

2. ####Practice:####
You will implement the previously gathered knowledge in simple coding activities.
Most important task numbers are listed in the "*Key Points*" section for each day and they should get most of your attention; if you feel you don’t have enough time to complete all tasks, start with these ones when possible.

3. ####Commit:####
You will commit all your code on a daily basis, when you finish your practice.

### Introduction

TBD

####Topic 0: Introduction to Object Oriented Programming Concepts (1 day)####

#####Reading:#####

1. Beginners: Java Concepts [basic tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/) (in case you need it!)

2. Beginners: Have fun with [Introduction](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J1a_Introduction.html).

3. Recommended: [jQuery Fundamentals](http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html) 

4. Explore [Design Patterns](http://www.avajava.com/tutorials/categories/design-patterns)

#####Extra documentation:#####

[TBD]

#####Practice:#####

1. [OPP Exercises](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/J3f_OOPExercises.html)

#####Key Points:#####

1, 5, 7, 10, 13

#####Commit:#####

Commit your practice code.
